# Universal time
An advanced computational implementation for analyzing time scales based on interpretations of texts and historical chronologies.

### Install
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/malakut-dev/universal-time.git"
cd universal-time
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
./universal_time

# or
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
./universal_time
```

This program calculates and compares different time scales based on:

- Traditional religious chronologies
- Metaphorical interpretations of sacred texts
- Comparisons with modern scientific time scales

### Main Time Scales

- Cosmic Time: 1 day = 1,000 human years (Quran 22:47)
- Divine Time: 1 day = 50,000 human years (Quran 70:4)
- Human Time: Standard Time Scale

### Available Analysis

- Calculation of elapsed time since historical milestones
- Comparison between multiple religious chronologies
- Future projections on different time scales
- Analysis of the relative speed of time
- Contextualization with the scientific age of the universe

### Compilation and execution prerequisites

- C compiler (GCC, Clang, or similar)
- Standard Math Library
