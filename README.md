# universal-time
An advanced computational implementation for analyzing time scales based on interpretations of texts and historical chronologies.



### Install
```sh
git clone "https://github.com/malakut-dev/universal-time.git"
cd universal-time
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```


This program calculates and compares different time scales based on:

- Traditional religious chronologies
- Metaphorical interpretations of sacred texts
- Comparisons with modern scientific time scales

Main Time Scales

- Cosmic Time: 1 day = 1,000 human years (Quran 22:47)
- Divine Time: 1 day = 50,000 human years (Quran 70:4)
= Human Time: Standard Time Scale

Available Analysis

- ✅ Calculation of elapsed time since historical milestones
- ✅ Comparison between multiple religious chronologies
- ✅ Future projections on different time scales
- ✅ Analysis of the relative speed of time
- ✅ Contextualization with the scientific age of the universe

🛠️ Compilation and Execution
Prerequisites

- C compiler (GCC, Clang, or similar)
- Standard Math Library
